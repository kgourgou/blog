Blog files
==========

Here you can find all the files (mainly codes) that I post or use on my blog, [R196, HH](http://inlieuofabettertitle.wordpress.com/). 

Most of the files are / will be python scripts or IPython notebooks, since that's the easiest/fastest for me to use, if I want to make the results in my code reproducible.

Everything is free to use as you see fit under the MIT License. If something seems useful to you, go right ahead and grab it. :-)

That being said, please keep in mind this disclaimer that I also have on my blog.

### Disclaimer

In a couple of cases, I may add code to a blog post in order for the reader to check that something holds or is reproducible. This is **the only** guarantee that I give regarding the code!

In other words, the code may or may not be : correct for general cases, "clean", written in the optimal way (whatever that may mean) or in any case produced with any other reason in mind than the one stated above.
