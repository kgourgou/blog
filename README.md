Blog files
==========

Here you can find all the files (mainly codes) that I post or use on my blog, [R196, HH](http://inlieuofabettertitle.wordpress.com/). 

Most of the files are / will be python scripts or IPython notebooks, since that's the easiest/fastest for me to use, if I want to make the results in my code reproducible.

Everything is free to use as you see fit under the MIT License.
